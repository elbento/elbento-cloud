A collection of self-hosted tools for the discerning Internet user

## Overview

The ever-increasing number of subscriptions for online services is not only unsustainable but
also is a threat to our self-determination and ownership of that which is important to us.

This project provides some approaches to retain ownership and control over online resources via
means of self-hosting applications and data.

## Hosting Models

Depending on your level of technical ability and resources available to you the following models for self-hosting
may be considered:

* elbento@home - host everything from your home/private computer
* elbento@cloud - host everything on public Cloud resources
* elbento@hybrid - partially host at home but route access via public Cloud

### elbento@home

Prerequisites:

* A fast Internet connection and preferably a static IP address
* An "always-on" computer such as a desktop PC, a laptop or a Raspberry Pi
* A supported operating system (e.g. Linux or MacOS)
